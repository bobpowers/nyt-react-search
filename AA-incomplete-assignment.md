Look, we all know that this is a sad excuse for a homework. I’ve set up most of the individual chunks independently, but I just never got around to connecting them all. 

I have the api call to NYT set up, but not connected up.

I have the model set up for Mongo, but not connected up

I do have the front end finished, but… you guessed it- not connected up because I wasnt yet returning the api results to the page.

I had a really hard time wrapping my head around this assignment (read: react) and how it all worked together until our final project. I’m actually motivated to complete this, but unfortuntely it wont happen till after the class is over.
